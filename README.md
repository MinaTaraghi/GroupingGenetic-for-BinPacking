# GroupingGenetic for BinPacking
 Matlab Implementation of Grouping Genetic Algorithm for the Bin Packing Problem
	Based on the paper by Emanuel Falkenauer:
	Falkenauer, Emanuel. "A hybrid grouping genetic algorithm for bin packing." Journal of heuristics 2, no. 1 (1996): 5-30.
	
	
Mother.m runs all the experiments 
The main implementation is GGA1.m Which creates the initial population and this initial item pool is then passed to other experiments' functions for comparison of performance

More detailed explanation of experiments and parameters can be found in the original paper and the pdf report file
